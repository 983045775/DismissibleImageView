# DismissibleImageView
Clickable ImageView that expands to full screen and is dismissible by swiping the image off-screen 

## To Do
* Update this README. Includes adding a video of the functionality.
* Add onShow() animation to the full screen view
* Move away from DialogFragment and try using a custom view or maybe a proper dialog
* Remove the Picasso dependency and any other that seems removable
* Refactor into nicer code
